### What is API Gateway ?
  - Amazon API Gateway is a fully managed service that makes it easy for developers to create, publish, maintain, monitor,
and secure APIs at any scale. APIs act as the "front door" for applications to access data, business logic, or functionality
from your backend services. Using API Gateway, you can create RESTful APIs and WebSocket APIs that enable real-time two-way 
communication applications. API Gateway supports containerized and serverless workloads, as well as web applications.
